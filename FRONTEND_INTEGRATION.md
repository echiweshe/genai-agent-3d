# Frontend Integration Instructions

The SimpleLLMTester component has been integrated into your frontend.

## How to Access the Tester

1. Make sure all services are running:
   ```
   cd genai_agent_project
   .env\Scriptsctivate
   python manage_services.py restart all
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/llm-test
   ```

## What to Expect

- The LLM Tester page will display a form with:
  - Provider selection dropdown
  - Model selection dropdown
  - Prompt input field
  - Generate button

- When you click Generate, it will send a request to the backend LLM service
  and display the response.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you don't see any providers in the dropdown:
   - Check that the backend is running correctly
   - Look for errors in the browser console
   - Try refreshing the page

2. If you get an error when generating text:
   - Ensure Ollama is running 
   - Check that the model specified is actually available in Ollama
   - Check the backend logs for errors

3. If the page doesn't load:
   - Make sure the frontend service is running
   - Check for any React errors in the console
