# Update Summary: API Key Fixes and Hunyuan3D Integration

This document summarizes the changes made to the GenAI Agent 3D project to fix the Claude API key issue and add Hunyuan3D integration.

## Changes Made

### Claude API Key Fix

1. **Fixed Anthropic API Headers**: Updated the headers in the LLM service to use the correct format for Anthropic API requests:
   - Changed `x-api-key` to `X-API-Key` (proper capitalization)
   - Ensured the correct Anthropic API version is used

2. **Enhanced Environment Loading**: Added improved environment variable loading with:
   - Created `enhanced_env_loader.py` for better environment variable handling
   - Added support for loading API keys from environment variables

3. **Diagnostics Tools**: Created scripts to help diagnose and fix API key issues:
   - `test_api_keys.py` to validate API keys by making test requests
   - `test_api_keys.bat` for easy Windows execution

### Hunyuan3D Integration

1. **Added Provider Support**: Updated the LLM service to support Hunyuan3D:
   - Added Hunyuan3D as a provider in `_discover_providers`
   - Created a `_generate_hunyuan3d` method to handle Hunyuan3D requests
   - Added placeholder implementation for Hunyuan3D API calls

2. **Configuration Support**: Added configuration support for Hunyuan3D:
   - Added `HUNYUAN3D_API_KEY` to the `.env` file
   - Added Hunyuan3D to the API key loader in `enhanced_env_loader.py`

3. **Setup Tools**: Created tools to help set up Hunyuan3D:
   - `setup_hunyuan3d.py` script to configure Hunyuan3D integration
   - Documentation in `HUNYUAN3D_README.md`

## Files Modified

- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/services/llm.py`: Updated API headers and added Hunyuan3D support
- `genai_agent_project/.env`: Added Hunyuan3D API key placeholder
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/services/enhanced_env_loader.py`: Created for improved environment loading

## Files Added

- `test_api_keys.py`: Script to test API keys
- `test_api_keys.bat`: Windows batch file to run the test script
- `setup_hunyuan3d.py`: Script to set up Hunyuan3D integration
- `HUNYUAN3D_README.md`: Documentation for Hunyuan3D integration

## How to Apply These Changes

These changes have been applied directly to your project files. To ensure they take effect:

1. Restart all services:
   ```bash
   python genai_agent_project/manage_services.py restart all
   ```

2. Test your API keys:
   ```bash
   python test_api_keys.py
   ```

3. If you want to set up Hunyuan3D, run:
   ```bash
   python setup_hunyuan3d.py
   ```

## Notes for Further Development

- The Hunyuan3D API implementation is a placeholder. The actual API endpoints and request formats should be updated once the official documentation is available.
- Consider adding a web UI component for configuring Hunyuan3D settings specifically.
- The API key testing mechanism can be expanded to include more detailed diagnostics.
