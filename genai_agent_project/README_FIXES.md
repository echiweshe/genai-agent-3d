# GenAI Agent 3D - Fixes and Improvements

This document describes the fixes and improvements made to the GenAI Agent 3D project to resolve various issues and enhance stability.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing asyncio Import**: Added the missing `asyncio` import in the LLM service.
2. **JSON Parsing Issues**: Improved the JSON parsing in the Scene Generator tool with robust extraction methods.
3. **Duplicate Files Removal**: Removed unnecessary duplicate files.
4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the codebase.
5. **Redis Connection Issues**: Fixed Redis connection handling to prevent errors.

## How to Run the Fixed Version

### Option 1: Automated Cleanup and Testing

Run the following command to automatically clean up the project and run integration tests:

```bash
python run_cleanup_and_test.py
```

This script will:
1. Run the cleanup script to remove duplicate files
2. Ensure Ollama server is running
3. Run integration tests to verify all components are working

### Option 2: Manual Steps

If you prefer to run the steps manually:

1. **Clean up the project**:
   ```bash
   python cleanup.py
   ```

2. **Start Ollama server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   python run.py ollama start
   ```

3. **Run integration tests**:
   ```bash
   python test_integration.py
   ```

4. **Run the interactive shell**:
   ```bash
   python run.py shell
   ```

## Using the Interactive Shell

Once you've verified that everything is working, you can use the interactive shell to work with the agent:

```bash
python run.py shell
```

Try these example commands:

```
> Create a scene with a mountain, a forest, and a lake
```

```
> Create a simple scene with a red cube on a blue plane
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Ollama**:
   ```bash
   python run.py ollama list
   ```
   This will show you available models. Make sure one of these models is specified in your `config.yaml` file.

2. **Verify Redis**:
   Make sure Redis is running on localhost:6379 (default) or update your config.yaml with the correct Redis configuration.

3. **Check the logs**:
   The application logs detailed information about what's happening. Look for error messages to identify the issue.

4. **Try a different model**:
   Some models may work better than others. Try using the smallest available model (like "deepseek-coder:latest" if available) by updating the `config.yaml` file.

## Model Recommendations

For best results, use these models in this order of preference (smallest to largest):

1. deepseek-coder:latest (776 MB)
2. llama3.2:latest (2.0 GB)
3. llama3:latest (4.7 GB)
4. deepseek-coder-v2:latest (8.9 GB)

Smaller models tend to have fewer timeout issues and better performance.
