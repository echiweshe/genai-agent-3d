## Next Steps

The following tasks are prioritized for the next development phase:

1. **Execution Integration**
   - Implement actual execution of generated Blender scripts
   - Connect model generator to Blender for real model creation

2. **Tool Enhancements**
   - Add support for more SVG operations
   - Implement Diagram Generator Tool
   - Add more advanced scene manipulation capabilities

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Add integration tests for tool interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows

4. **Deployment**
   - Create Docker setup
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Add distribution packaging

5. **Documentation**
   - Improve API documentation
   - Add more examples
   - Create user guide

## Known Issues

1. **Model Compatibility**
   - Some Ollama models may have naming inconsistencies
   - The error handling for model not found needs improvement

2. **Performance**
   - Large operations may cause memory issues
   - No caching mechanism implemented yet

3. **Integration**
   - Limited error handling for Blender script execution
   - No support for real-time feedback during long operations
