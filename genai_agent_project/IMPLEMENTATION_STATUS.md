## Planned Components

### Advanced Features
- 📝 Asset Manager for managing 3D assets
- 📝 Animation Pipeline for complex animations
- 📝 Rendering Queue for background rendering
- 📝 Web-based UI for easier interaction

### Integration
- 📝 Integration with Hunyuan-3D for model generation

- 📝 Support for cloud-based rendering

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate Existing SceneX Code**
   - Use the integration tool to analyze and incorporate your SceneX codebase
   - Update the SceneX tool to use your actual implementation

2. **Enhance LLM Integration**
   - Test with different models to find the best balance of quality and performance
   - Develop specialized prompts for 3D modeling tasks

3. **Add Custom Tools**
   - Based on your specific workflow needs
   - Potentially integrate with other 3D tools

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Comprehensive testing with complex scenes
   - Performance optimization for resource-intensive operations
