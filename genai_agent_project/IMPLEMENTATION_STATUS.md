## Next Steps

The following tasks are prioritized for the next development phase:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add unit tests for core components and integrations
   - Add integration tests for tool interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows

2. **User Interface Development**
   - Create a simple web UI for interacting with the agent
   - Add result visualization capabilities
   - Implement interactive scene editing

3. **Docker and Deployment**
   - Create Docker setup for consistent environment
   - Docker Compose for multi-service deployment
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching mechanisms for LLM responses
   - Add result caching for repetitive operations
   - Memory optimization for large model processing

5. **Documentation**
   - Improve API documentation
   - Add more examples
   - Create comprehensive user guide

## Known Issues

1. **External Dependencies**
   - External integrations require separate installation and setup
   - Some integrations may have compatibility issues with different versions

2. **Performance**
   - Large operations may cause memory issues
   - No caching mechanism implemented yet
   - Hunyuan-3D and other ML tools may require significant GPU resources

3. **Integration**
   - Limited error handling for external tool execution
   - No support for real-time feedback during long operations
