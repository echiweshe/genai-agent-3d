## Next Steps

The following tasks are prioritized for the next development phase:

1. **Enhanced Tool Integration**
   - Add support for more complex diagram types
   - Implement more advanced materials and lighting setup for 3D models
   - Develop a more comprehensive scene composition system

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Add integration tests for tool interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows

3. **UI Development**
   - Create a simple web UI for interacting with the agent
   - Add result visualization capabilities
   - Implement interactive scene editing

4. **Deployment**
   - Create Docker setup
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Add distribution packaging

5. **Documentation**
   - Improve API documentation
   - Add more examples
   - Create comprehensive user guide

## Known Issues

1. **Model Compatibility**
   - Some Ollama models may have naming inconsistencies
   - The error handling for model not found needs improvement

2. **Performance**
   - Large operations may cause memory issues
   - No caching mechanism implemented yet

3. **Integration**
   - Limited error handling for Blender script execution
   - No support for real-time feedback during long operations
