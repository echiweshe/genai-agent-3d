# GenAI Agent 3D - LLM Integration Fixes

This package contains fixes for the LLM integration issues in the GenAI Agent 3D project. The main errors being addressed are:

1. `LLMService.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`
2. `inet_pton() argument 2 must be str, not dict`

## Quick Fix

For the fastest way to fix these issues:

1. Run the fix script:
   ```
   python fix_llm_errors.py
   ```
   
   Or double-click the `fix_llm_errors.bat` file (on Windows)

2. Restart the services when prompted or manually with:
   ```
   python restart_services.py
   ```

3. Access the web interface at http://localhost:3000

## Files Included

### Fix Scripts
- `fix_llm_errors.py` - Main script that fixes all LLM-related errors
- `fix_llm_errors.bat` - Windows batch file wrapper for the fix script
- `restart_services.py` - Script to restart all services after applying fixes

### Documentation
- `LLM_ERROR_FIXES.md` - Detailed explanation of the errors and fixes
- `LLM_FIX_README.md` - This README file

### API Files
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/api/llm.py` - Fixed LLM API endpoints
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/api/app.py` - API application initialization
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/api/__init__.py` - API package initialization

### Service Files
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/services/llm.py` - LLM service implementation
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/services/redis_bus.py` - Fixed Redis message bus
- `genai_agent_project/genai_agent/services/llm_api_routes.py` - Fixed LLM API routes

## What the Fixes Do

### Fix 1: LLM Service Initialization
The first fix addresses the error where the LLM service is being initialized with a configuration parameter that it doesn't accept. The fix involves:

- Updating the LLM API routes to create the LLM service without passing a configuration parameter
- Ensuring the LLM service loads its configuration from the settings

### Fix 2: Redis Connection Error
The second fix addresses the error where the Redis message bus is trying to use a dictionary for the host parameter of `inet_pton()`. The fix involves:

- Updating the Redis message bus to handle dictionary configurations
- Extracting the host and port from the dictionary configuration
- Using the extracted values for connection and logging

### Fix 3: API Structure
Additional fixes to ensure proper API structure:

- Creating proper API initialization files
- Ensuring the FastAPI application is properly set up
- Adding health check endpoints

## After Applying the Fixes

After applying the fixes, you should be able to:

1. Start all services successfully
2. Access the web interface at http://localhost:3000
3. Use the LLM Test page to interact with language models
4. Generate text using the API

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after applying the fixes:

1. **Check console output** for specific error messages
2. **Verify Redis is running** properly (the message bus relies on Redis)
3. **Verify Ollama is running** and has at least one model installed
4. **Try restarting services manually** after stopping them completely

If you need to make additional changes, the fix script creates backups of modified files with a `.bak` extension.

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain compatibility with the existing codebase
- No changes to the database schema or API interfaces were required
- The LLM service still uses the same configuration file format
