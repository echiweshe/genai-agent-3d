# SVG to Video Pipeline: Project Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the SVG to Video pipeline implementation plan. The entire implementation has been broken down into separate guides for better manageability and easier implementation.

## Pipeline Overview

The SVG to Video pipeline converts SVG diagrams (generated by Claude or other LLMs) into animated 3D videos. The pipeline consists of four main stages:

1. **SVG Generation**: Using LangChain to prompt LLMs to create SVG diagrams
2. **3D Model Conversion**: Converting SVG elements to 3D objects in Blender
3. **Animation**: Adding animations and camera movements with SceneX
4. **Video Rendering**: Producing the final video output

## Implementation Strategy

Our implementation strategy prioritizes getting a working end-to-end pipeline quickly, with minimal infrastructure changes. We'll build the core functionality first, then enhance with more robust infrastructure components later.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (2-4 Weeks)
- Build individual components for each stage of the pipeline
- Create simple Python orchestration for connecting components
- Implement basic error handling and logging
- Test with sample diagrams

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Integration (2-3 Weeks)
- Integrate with LangChain and Redis messaging system
- Implement service layer for handling requests
- Add robust error handling and recovery
- Enhance monitoring and logging

## Document Structure

The implementation plan is divided into the following documents:

1. **Project Overview** (this document)
2. **SVG Generation Component** - Implementation of LangChain-based SVG generator
3. **SVG to 3D Conversion Component** - Blender-based conversion of SVG to 3D models
4. **Animation System Component** - SceneX animation implementation
5. **Video Rendering Component** - Blender rendering setup
6. **Pipeline Orchestration** - Integration of all components
7. **Infrastructure Integration** - Redis and LangChain service integration
8. **Testing and Deployment Guide** - Testing strategies and deployment considerations

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
- **LLM Framework**: LangChain with multiple providers (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama)
- **3D Modeling**: Blender (via Python API)
- **Messaging**: Redis (initially), with plans to migrate to RabbitMQ 
- **Future Enhancements**: Kubernetes, Ray for distributed rendering, OpenTelemetry

## Next Steps

Refer to the individual component guides for detailed implementation instructions. Start with the SVG Generation component and work through the pipeline in order.
