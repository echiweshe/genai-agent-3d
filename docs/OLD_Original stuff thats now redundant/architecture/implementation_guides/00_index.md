# SVG to Video Pipeline Implementation Guides

This directory contains a comprehensive set of implementation guides for the SVG to Video pipeline. These guides provide detailed information on all components of the system, from SVG generation to video rendering, as well as infrastructure integration, testing, and deployment.

## Guide Index

3. [SVG to 3D Conversion Component](03_svg_to_3d_conversion_component.md) - Blender-based 3D conversion
4. [Animation System Component](04_animation_system_component.md) - SceneX animation implementation
   - [Animation System Continued](04_animation_system_component_part2.md)
5. [Video Rendering Component](05_video_rendering_component.md) - Blender rendering setup
6. [Pipeline Orchestration](06_pipeline_orchestration.md) - Integration of all components
   - [Pipeline Orchestration Continued](06_pipeline_orchestration_part2.md)
7. [Infrastructure Integration](07_infrastructure_integration.md) - Redis and LangChain service integration
   - [Infrastructure Integration Continued](07_infrastructure_integration_part2.md)
8. [Testing and Deployment Guide](08_testing_and_deployment_guide.md) - Testing strategies and deployment options
   - [Testing and Deployment Continued](08_testing_and_deployment_guide_part2.md)
   - [Testing and Deployment Final Part](08_testing_and_deployment_guide_part3.md)

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for incremental development and testing. The guides follow this strategic approach:

1. **Phase 1: Core Implementation** - Building individual components
2. **Phase 2: Integration** - Connecting components into a pipeline
3. **Phase 3: Infrastructure** - Adding messaging and service capabilities
4. **Phase 4: Optimization** - Enhancing performance and reliability
5. **Phase 5: Deployment** - Setting up for production use

## How to Use These Guides

- Start with the [Project Overview](01_project_overview.md) to understand the system architecture
- Follow the component guides in numerical order for a step-by-step implementation
- Use the [Testing and Deployment Guide](08_testing_and_deployment_guide.md) for validation and production setup

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- Blender 3.0+
- Redis
- LangChain and related libraries
- API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Quick Start

To get started quickly:

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Set up your API keys as environment variables
3. Implement the SVG Generator component
4. Implement the SVG to 3D Conversion component
5. Follow the Pipeline Orchestration guide to connect them
6. Test with a simple diagram concept
