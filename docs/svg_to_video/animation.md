# Animation System

## Overview

The Animation System is responsible for applying animations to 3D objects generated from SVG diagrams. It analyzes the diagram type and content to create context-aware animations that effectively communicate the diagram's purpose and flow.

## Architecture

The Animation System consists of the following components:

1. **Animation Analyzer**: Analyzes the diagram structure and element relationships
2. **Animation Generator**: Creates animation sequences based on diagram type
3. **Animation Applier**: Applies animations to 3D objects using Blender
4. **Animation Templates**: Predefined animation patterns for different diagram types

## Usage

```python
from genai_agent.svg_to_video.animation import AnimationSystem

# Create an animation system instance
animation_system = AnimationSystem(debug=True)

# Animate a 3D scene
input_blend = "path/to/input.blend"
output_blend = "path/to/animated.blend"
diagram_type = "flowchart"  # Optional: specify diagram type

result = animation_system.animate(
    input_file=input_blend,
    output_file=output_blend,
    diagram_type=diagram_type,
    duration=10  # Animation duration in seconds
)

if result:
    print(f"Successfully animated {input_blend} to {output_blend}")
else:
    print("Animation failed")
```

## Animation Analyzer

The Animation Analyzer performs:

- Structural analysis of the diagram
- Identification of element relationships (connections, hierarchy, etc.)
- Detection of flow direction
- Classification of element types (nodes, connectors, labels, etc.)

## Animation Generator

The Animation Generator creates:

- Keyframe sequences for element animations
- Timing and sequencing of animations
- Camera movements and transitions
- Special effects based on diagram type

### Animation Strategies

- **Sequential**: Elements appear and animate in a logical sequence
- **Hierarchical**: Parent-child relationships dictate animation order
- **Radial**: Animations radiate from central elements
- **Flow-based**: Animations follow the flow indicated by connectors

## Animation Templates

The system includes specialized animation templates for different diagram types:

### Flowchart Animations

- Sequential highlighting of process steps
- Emphasis on decision points
- Flow indication along connectors
- Timing based on process complexity

### Network Diagram Animations

- Node appearance and connection establishment
- Data flow visualization along connections
- Highlight of central nodes
- Pulse effects for activity indication

### Sequence Diagram Animations

- Time-based animation of interactions
- Message passing visualization
- Actor/object highlighting
- Step-by-step sequence revelation

### Entity-Relationship Animations

- Entity introduction and relationship establishment
- Attribute revelation
- Key highlighting
- Relationship type indication

## Blender Integration

The Animation System integrates with Blender through:

1. Python scripting using the Blender Python API (bpy)
2. Creating animation keyframes for objects, materials, and camera
3. Using Blender's animation system features (F-Curves, drivers, etc.)
4. Setting up render parameters for the animation

## Customization

### Animation Parameters

The animation behavior can be customized with various parameters:

- **duration**: Overall animation duration in seconds
- **timing_function**: Controls the timing curve (linear, ease-in, ease-out, etc.)
- **element_duration**: Duration of individual element animations
- **delay_between_elements**: Time delay between consecutive element animations
- **camera_movement**: Type of camera movement during animation

### Special Effects

Special effects can be added to enhance the animation:

- **glow_effects**: Highlight important elements with glow
- **particle_effects**: Add particle systems for dynamic elements
- **text_effects**: Animate text elements with special effects
- **connector_effects**: Add flow animations along connectors

## Advanced Features

### Camera Animation

The system can create camera animations based on the diagram:

- Automated camera path generation
- Focus on important elements
- Smooth transitions between diagram sections
- Zoom effects for detail highlighting

### Material Animation

Material properties can be animated:

- Color transitions
- Opacity changes
- Emission intensity for highlighting
- Texture animations

### Dynamic Effects

The system supports dynamic effects:

- Particles for data flow visualization
- Physics-based animations for interactive elements
- Procedural animations based on diagram structure
- Real-time response visualization

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance:

- Use simplified 3D models for complex diagrams
- Limit the number of simultaneous animations
- Use efficient animation techniques for large scenes
- Consider baking animations for complex effects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Animation Timing Problems**
   
   **Symptom**: Animations are too fast, too slow, or poorly synchronized
   
   **Solution**: Adjust duration and timing parameters, check keyframe spacing

2. **Missing Animations**

   **Symptom**: Some elements don't animate or have incorrect animations
   
   **Solution**: Check element names and structure, ensure compatibility with animation system

3. **Camera Issues**

   **Symptom**: Camera movements are jerky or miss important elements
   
   **Solution**: Adjust camera animation parameters, check keyframe interpolation

4. **Rendering Performance**

   **Symptom**: Animation rendering is slow or crashes
   
   **Solution**: Simplify animations, reduce special effects, optimize scene complexity
