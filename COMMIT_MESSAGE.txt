Fix and integrate SVG to Video pipeline

This commit fixes several issues with the SVG to Video pipeline and properly integrates it with the GenAI Agent 3D project:

- Fixed SVG output directory structure issues
- Fixed integration with Claude Direct API for SVG generation
- Created stub implementations for mathutils module and ModelAnimator
- Fixed Claude provider 'count_tokens' error
- Added synchronization scripts for SVG directories
- Added comprehensive documentation for the pipeline
- Created test scripts to validate functionality
- Updated import statements to use correct project structure
- Added fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies

The SVG generation component is now fully functional in the web UI, while the 3D conversion, animation, and rendering components require Blender installation and additional setup.

This integration provides users with a complete workflow from text descriptions to SVG diagrams, with the foundation for 3D conversion and animation in place for future development.
