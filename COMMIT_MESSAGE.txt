Fix SVG to Video pipeline: Add debug param to SVGTo3DConverter and fix frontend icon issue

This commit addresses two critical issues in the SVG to Video pipeline:

1. Backend fix: Added debug parameter to SVGTo3DConverter class
   - Updated __init__ method to accept and store debug flag and additional kwargs
   - Fixed error: "TypeError: SVGTo3DConverter.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'debug'"

2. Frontend fix: Resolved lucide-react icon import issue
   - Changed Cube3d (which doesn't exist) to Cube in BlenderIntegration.js
   - Ensures frontend loads properly without React component errors

Additional improvements:
- Added restart_backend.bat for convenient backend service management
- Added restart_frontend.bat for frontend service restarts
- Created comprehensive check_svg_pipeline_status.py for system verification
- Added test_pipeline.py for end-to-end pipeline testing
- Created SVG_PIPELINE_FIXES.md documentation
- Added install_frontend_deps.bat for dependency management

These changes complete the SVG to Video pipeline integration, enabling the full
text-to-SVG-to-3D-to-video workflow in the GenAI Agent 3D system.
