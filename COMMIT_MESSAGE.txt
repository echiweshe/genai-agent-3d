Add SVG generation with direct LLM integration

This commit implements SVG generation capabilities with direct LLM integration:

- Created modular SVG generator with support for multiple LLM providers
- Implemented direct Claude API integration for SVG generation
- Added LangChain integrations for OpenAI and other providers
- Created support for Redis-based LLM service integration
- Developed standalone testing tools and scripts
- Added SVG viewer utility with browser preview
- Implemented a GUI application for SVG generation
- Fixed issues with directory structure and error handling
- Added comprehensive documentation

The SVG generator can now be used independently from the 3D conversion
pipeline while maintaining compatibility for future integration.
