# Security Fixes for GenAI Agent 3D

This document summarizes the security improvements made to protect API keys and sensitive information in the GenAI Agent 3D project.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Sensitive Information from Files

- Removed API keys from `config.yaml` and replaced with placeholders
- Removed API keys from `.env` files and replaced with placeholders
- Created template files that can be safely committed to the repository

### 2. Added Secure Configuration Tools

- Created `setup_configuration.py` for secure API key management
- This script allows users to set up their configuration files locally without committing sensitive information
- Added `.gitignore` entries to prevent accidentally committing sensitive files

### 3. Created Documentation and Guidelines

- Created `API_KEYS_README.md` with best practices for managing API keys
- Created `GITHUB_PUSH_FIX.md` to help resolve the GitHub push protection issues
- Added template files (`.env.template` and `config.template.yaml`) to show the expected format without revealing actual keys

### 4. Implemented Secure File Structure

- Configuration files with actual API keys are now local-only
- Template files are provided as examples
- Setup scripts help users create proper local configuration
- `.gitignore` prevents sensitive files from being committed

## How to Use the New Secure Configuration

### Setting Up Configuration

1. Run the setup script:
   ```
   python setup_configuration.py
   ```
   or use the batch file:
   ```
   setup_configuration.bat
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter your API keys
   - These will be saved only to your local machine
   - They will not be committed to the repository

### Managing API Keys

- Add or update API keys using the management tool:
  ```
  python manage_system.py
  ```
  Then select "API Key Management" from the menu

### What to Commit vs. What Not to Commit

**Safe to Commit:**
- Template files (`.env.template`, `config.template.yaml`)
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- Code (`.py`, `.js`, etc.)
- Setup and utility scripts

**NEVER Commit:**
- Actual configuration files with API keys (`.env`, `config.yaml`)
- Any file containing API keys or access tokens
- Private credentials of any kind

## Rotating API Keys

Since some API keys were previously committed to the repository, you should:

1. Generate new API keys from your providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
2. Update your local configuration with the new keys
3. Revoke the old keys that were exposed in the repository

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Use Environment Variables**: For production deployments, consider using environment variables instead of configuration files.

2. **Consider Secret Managers**: For production systems, use AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or similar services.

3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically audit your repository to ensure no secrets are accidentally committed.

4. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Consider using git pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.
