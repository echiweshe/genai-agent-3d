## Using the Updated System

After applying these updates, the GenAI Agent 3D system should now:

1. Show as "Online" in the status display
2. Have Claude set as the default LLM provider
3. Be able to generate text using the LLM Test interface
4. Have improved error handling and stability

To get started:

1. Restart the services after applying the updates:
   ```
   python restart_claude.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   restart_with_claude.bat
   ```

2. Open the web interface at http://localhost:3000

3. Verify the system is showing as "Online"

4. Test the LLM functionality with the LLM Test interface

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all services are running (Redis, Ollama, backend, frontend)
3. Verify API keys are correctly set in the .env files and config.yaml
4. Try restarting services with `python restart_services.py`
