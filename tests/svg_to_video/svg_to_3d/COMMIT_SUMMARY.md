# SVG to 3D Converter - Commit Summary

## Overview
This commit adds a functional SVG to 3D converter with basic shape support and proper 3D extrusion. While the core functionality works, some advanced features like transparency and strokes on mesh objects need further development.

## Working Features ✅
- All basic SVG shapes convert to 3D
- Text elements render properly with improved scaling
- Fill colors work correctly
- Scene setup with camera and lighting
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance

## Known Limitations ❌
1. **Transparency**: Materials appear solid regardless of opacity settings
2. **Strokes on Meshes**: Circles don't show strokes properly
3. **Stroke-Only Shapes**: Elements with fill="none" have rendering issues

## Technical Details
- Uses Blender's Python API for 3D conversion
- Modular design with separate components for parsing, creation, and materials
- Comprehensive test suite included
- Documentation for current status and future work

## Next Steps
1. Fix material transparency with proper node setup
2. Implement stroke rendering for mesh objects
3. Consider geometry nodes or alternative approaches
4. Add visual verification tests

## Files Changed
- Added SVG parser and converter modules
- Created material handling system
- Implemented shape creation methods
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Documented current status and limitations

This is a solid foundation for SVG to 3D conversion, with clear documentation of what works and what needs improvement.
