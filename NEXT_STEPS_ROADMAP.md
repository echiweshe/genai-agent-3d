This document outlines the next steps in the development roadmap for the GenAI Agent 3D project after completing the Claude API and Hunyuan3D integrations.

## Current Status

We have successfully:
- Fixed the OpenAI integration
- Fixed the Ollama integration
- Completed the Claude API integration ✓
- Completed the Hunyuan3D integration via fal.ai ✓

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fix Output Directory Linking Issues

**Priority: High**

The current system has issues with linking output directories, which causes problems with file access and content preview.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Ensure symbolic links are properly created for all output directories
- [ ] Update file path handling in frontend components
- [ ] Add validation to verify file access
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for missing files
- [ ] Add retry logic for file access operations

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
def fix_output_directories():
    """Fix output directory linking issues"""
    # Ensure all output directories exist
    for dir_name in ["models", "scenes", "diagrams", "svg", "blendergpt", "hunyuan", "trellis"]:
        os.makedirs(f"output/{dir_name}", exist_ok=True)
    
    # Create symbolic links if needed
    for dir_name in ["models", "scenes", "diagrams", "svg"]:
        target_path = os.path.abspath(f"output/{dir_name}")
        link_path = os.path.abspath(f"genai_agent_project/web/frontend/public/{dir_name}")
        
        # Create link if it doesn't exist or is broken
        if not os.path.exists(link_path) or not os.path.samefile(target_path, link_path):
            # Remove existing link if it exists
            if os.path.exists(link_path):
                if os.path.islink(link_path):
                    os.unlink(link_path)
                else:
                    shutil.rmtree(link_path)
            
            # Create new symbolic link
            os.symlink(target_path, link_path, target_is_directory=True)
```

### 2. Fix Content Preview in Generator Pages

**Priority: High**

Currently, content previews in the generator pages are not working correctly due to file path issues.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix file path handling in preview components
- [ ] Add loading indicators during content generation
- [ ] Implement auto-refresh for previews when content is updated
- [ ] Add fallback content when previews are unavailable
- [ ] Improve error messaging for failed previews

### 3. Enhance Model Generation with Detailed Prompting

**Priority: Medium**

The current model generation lacks detailed prompting capabilities, which limits the quality of generated models.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create prompt templates for different model types
- [ ] Implement material and texture prompting
- [ ] Add support for model variants
- [ ] Create a prompt library with examples
- [ ] Implement prompt validation and suggestion

**Prompt Template Example:**
```json
{
  "template_name": "Architectural Element",
  "base_prompt": "A highly detailed {style} {element} with {material} texture, suitable for architectural visualization",
  "parameters": {
    "style": ["modern", "classical", "gothic", "art deco", "industrial"],
    "element": ["column", "doorway", "window", "balcony", "staircase"],
    "material": ["marble", "wood", "concrete", "metal", "glass"]
  },
  "negative_prompt": "low quality, distorted proportions, unrealistic scale"
}
```

## Medium-term Goals

### 1. Develop the SVG to 3D Pipeline

**Priority: High**

Implement the SVG to 3D workflow to transform 2D diagrams into 3D visualizations.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement Claude-based SVG diagram generation
- [ ] Create SVG element extraction tools
- [ ] Build SVG to 3D model conversion process
- [ ] Develop animation sequencing for 3D elements
- [ ] Add material mapping from SVG styles to 3D materials

**Technical Approach:**
1. Use Claude's SVG generation capabilities to create well-structured diagrams
2. Parse SVG to extract elements (nodes, connectors, text)
3. Map 2D elements to 3D representations:
   - Rectangles → Cubes/Panels
   - Circles → Spheres/Cylinders
   - Paths → Extruded shapes
   - Text → 3D text objects
4. Position elements in 3D space based on 2D layout
5. Apply materials and textures based on SVG styles

### 2. Develop the SceneX Animation System

**Priority: Medium**

Create a Python-based animation system (inspired by Manim) for 3D scene animations.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement coordinate system for precise object placement
- [ ] Create animation primitives (fade, move, transform)
- [ ] Build animation sequencing system
- [ ] Develop camera control for scene framing
- [ ] Create Python API for animation control

**Sample Code:**
```python
# Example SceneX animation script
from scenex import SceneX, FadeIn, Move, Connect, Highlight

def create_architecture_animation():
    scene = SceneX(resolution=(1920, 1080))
    
    # Load elements
    server = scene.load_element("server")
    database = scene.load_element("database")
    clients = scene.load_elements("client_*")
    
    # Create animation sequence
    scene.play(FadeIn(server))
    scene.play(FadeIn(database, duration=1.5))
    
    for client in clients:
        scene.play(FadeIn(client, duration=0.5))
    
    scene.play(Connect(clients, server))
    scene.play(Connect(server, database))
    
    scene.play(Highlight(database))
    scene.camera.moveTo(database, duration=2.0)
    
    # Render to video
    scene.render("architecture_animation.mp4")
```

### 3. Improve Scene Generation with Environmental Details

**Priority: Medium**

Enhance scene generation with better environmental details and composition.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add lighting presets for different environments
- [ ] Implement camera positioning options
- [ ] Create environmental elements (sky, ground, backgrounds)
- [ ] Add support for scene composition with existing models
- [ ] Implement physics-based material rendering

## Long-term Goals

### 1. Build PowerPoint Integration

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create rendering queue system
- [ ] Add video processing options (resolution, format, compression)
- [ ] Support automatic voiceover generation
- [ ] Implement subtitle and annotation systems
- [ ] Add video composition for multi-scene presentations

### 3. Build End-to-End Training Material Generation

**Priority: Low**

Create a system for generating complete training materials.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create curriculum planning tools
- [ ] Implement multi-module content generation
- [ ] Support various output formats (video, slides, documentation)
- [ ] Add assessment and quiz generation
- [ ] Implement content adaptation for different audience levels

## Implementation Priorities

For each development phase, the following priorities should be considered:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Focus on fixing existing issues before adding new features
2. **User Experience**: Improve the frontend components and error handling
3. **Integration**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with changes
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing for all new features

## Resource Allocation

Suggested resource allocation:

| Phase | Engineering Effort | Timeline |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Fix Current Issues | 20% | 2 weeks |
| Core Features | 40% | 4-6 weeks |
| Advanced Features | 30% | 6-8 weeks |
| Production Features | 10% | 8-12 weeks |

## Success Metrics

The following metrics should be used to evaluate progress:

1. **Stability**: Reduction in error rates and system crashes
2. **Usability**: User satisfaction with the interface and workflows
3. **Content Quality**: Quality of generated 3D models, scenes, and animations
4. **Generation Time**: Time required to generate content from instructions
5. **Integration Success**: Ability to connect with external tools and platforms

## Conclusion

By following this roadmap, the GenAI Agent 3D project will continue to evolve into a powerful system for generating 3D-enhanced training and educational content. The immediate focus should be on fixing the current issues with output directories and content previews, followed by enhancing the core generation capabilities and developing the SVG to 3D pipeline.
