# GenAI Agent 3D - Milestone v1.0

This milestone represents the first working end-to-end system of the GenAI Agent 3D project. This README documents the current state, key components, and how to restore this milestone if needed.

## Milestone Description

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: April 20, 2025
**Description**: First working end-to-end system with Blender script execution and 3D model generation functionality.

## Key Components

1. **Backend Server**
   - FastAPI server with proper routing
   - Integration with Redis for messaging
   - Integration with Blender for script execution
   - Tool registry system for extensibility

2. **Frontend Interface**
   - React-based web UI
   - Blender script browser and execution
   - 3D model visualization
   - Realtime updates via WebSockets

3. **Core Functionality**
   - Blender script execution
   - 3D model generation
   - Scene management
   - Tool execution framework

## How to Use This Milestone

This milestone has been preserved in a dedicated git branch to ensure we can always return to this working state if needed.

### To access this milestone:

```bash
git checkout milestone-v1.0
```

### To continue development:

```bash
git checkout main
```

### To restore this milestone state to main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge milestone-v1.0
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Redis ping method needed to be added manually
- Health endpoint required manual addition
- Blender path needs to be configured properly
- Some optional integrations are not available (BlenderGPT, Hunyuan-3D, TRELLIS)

## Next Steps

Future development should focus on:

1. Improving error handling and robustness
2. Enhancing the 3D model generation capabilities
3. Expanding tool integrations
4. Improving the UI/UX for model creation and manipulation
5. Adding more comprehensive testing
